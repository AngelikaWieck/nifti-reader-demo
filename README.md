Currently this nifti reader is a simple JavaScript Web App.
The idea is to make TypeScript version out of it and later on build a React Component.

Use the `nifti-reader-js` package when implementing this component in React.
I am only using the `nifti-reader-min.js` file, because I didn't want to set up webpack.
